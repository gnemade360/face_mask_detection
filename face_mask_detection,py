Detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not requires the use of computer vision and deep learning techniques. In this example, I'll provide a basic outline of a face mask detection program using the TensorFlow framework with the MobileNetV2 model.

Please note that building a robust face mask detection system often requires a large dataset, a more sophisticated model, and fine-tuning. This example serves as a starting point for your understanding.

Install Dependencies:
You'll need to install the necessary libraries. You can use pip to install TensorFlow and OpenCV:

Copy code
pip install tensorflow opencv-python
Download the Model:
Download the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model from TensorFlow Hub. This model is trained on a large dataset of images, including masked and unmasked faces.

python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub

model_url = "https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/ssd_mobilenet_v2/2"
model = hub.load(model_url)
Capture Video Stream:
Use OpenCV to capture the video stream from the webcam or a video file.

python
Copy code
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # To capture video from the webcam (change 0 to video file path if using a file)
Face Mask Detection:
Process each frame from the video stream and use the pre-trained model to detect faces and check for face masks.

python
Copy code
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Preprocess frame for the model
    input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(frame)
    input_tensor = input_tensor[tf.newaxis, ...]

    # Perform face mask detection
    results = model(input_tensor)

    # Process the results to detect faces and check for masks
    # Display results on the frame (e.g., draw bounding boxes and labels)

    cv2.imshow("Face Mask Detection", frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Please note that the code above is a basic outline and may require additional processing and optimizations for better performance and accuracy. 
Additionally, you'll need to adapt the code to draw bounding boxes around detected faces and labels indicating whether they are wearing masks or not.

For a more robust and accurate face mask detection system, 
consider using larger datasets, data augmentation techniques, and fine-tuning the model. 
It is also essential to consider privacy and ethical implications when deploying face-related applications.
